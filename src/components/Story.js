                            <p>Hype Birdz are a collection of randomly generated NFT birds flying and exploring the Ethereum
                                blockchain. Our team of experts developed a proprietary AI algorithm that splits each of the
                                artist’s attributes into various components. Those components are then selected randomly by the
                                generative software to create concoctions, each one a unique NFT portraying the artist’s artwork.
                                </p>
                            <p>  We truly believe that delivering a real tangible value to holders is the only long-term and
